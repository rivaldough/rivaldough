# 👋 Hi, I’m Rivaldo

I’m transitioning from a career as a **chef** into the **cybersecurity space**, combining a background in computer networking with a hands-on approach to Blue Team operations. My goal is to defend organizations from threats by building skills in SOC operations, SIEM, and cloud security.
