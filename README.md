# 👋 Hi, I’m Rivaldo

I’m transitioning from a career as a chef into the cloud security space, combining a background in computer networking with a hands-on, analytical approach to defensive security. My goal is to help organizations secure and monitor their cloud environments by building practical skills in AWS, SIEM, and identity management.
